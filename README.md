# Overview
  ### Description
  Word Tetris is a web game that tests your typing skills. Type the word correctly before it falls to the bottom of the screen. Word Tetris is built on JavaScript with a Ruby on Rails back-end.
  
  ### Features
  - Interactive typing game with falling words
  - Choose three different difficulties that effects the speed of the falling words
  - High Score display with current time and score value
  - Animations based on accuracy, time and speed
  
  ### Challenges
  - The words were to be dynamically generated to create a more varied play-environment
    - Word was generated through connecting to [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and grabbing the words from the articles
  - Animating the words to fall down and removing them when the correct spelling of the word was entered
    - Used CSS `style` tag to manipulate the position of the words over time
    - Used JavaScript event listeners to check when the correct (or incorrect) spelling was entered
    - Changed the interval for rate at which words fall when corresponding difficult is selected
    - Changed the speed at which words fall when time passes 30 and 60 seconds respectively
