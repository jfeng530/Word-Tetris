# Word Tetris
Word Tetris is a project made by my partner, Emirhan Kaplan ([@emskaplann](https://github.com/emskaplann)) and I. It is a simple typing game where the objective is to type the word correctly before it falls to the bottom of the screen. Through the efforts of my partner, this project is also available as a cross-platform mobile application.
